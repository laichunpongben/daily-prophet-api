Make the following piece of introduction easy to understand, and correct any grammar mistakes. 

The Longer Story:
Where do you get the latest information everyday? If you use an Android phone like I do, it's probably the first page that Google pushes the feeds to you, or the infinite posts and stories you explore on Facebook or Instagram. And for some topics that interest you and you wanna dig deeper, you do searches with Google, YouTube videos, forums. and so on. This has been good, but I can't help notice some pain points:
(1) Many pieces of information that come to you in the feeds are irrelevant. It's "polluted", because: (i) they are only guessing what you like based on your past browsing history and what people like you read; (ii) there are many ads; (iii) you may be interested in some new topics now. The algorithm that gives you the feeds is a black-box to you, and it most likely relies on your feedback heavily to tweak. You have little or no control on what pops in the feed next. 
(2) You have many interesting subjects, but they are scattered in different trusted sources where you look for them. You may be viewing some pop music videos on YouTube, then reading some financial headlines on Bloomberg, then looking for some discussion on the last soccer match that your favorite team played in Reddit. That's a lot of clicks every day even for the subjects on top of your head; let alone for those that you actually want updates but you forget. 

So this app basically does 2 things: Make the sources and subjects to your control, and put it in one place. Easy reading!

THE LONGER STORY

Wondering where to get your daily information fix? If you're an Android user, like me, it's probably the first page where Google sends you updates, or the endless stream of posts on Facebook and Instagram. When you want to delve deeper into topics that interest you, you turn to Google searches, YouTube videos, forums, and more. While this has been convenient, I can't help but notice some drawbacks:

(1) Much of the information that lands in your feeds is irrelevant and, in a way, "polluted." This happens because: (i) the system guesses your preferences based on your past browsing history and what people similar to you are reading, and this guesswork can be inaccurate; (ii) your interests may have shifted. The algorithm has been a mystery, relying heavily on your feedback for adjustments; (iii) there are numerous ads. You have little or no control over what pops up in the feed next.

(2) You have a multitude of interesting subjects, but they're scattered across different trusted sources. You might be watching pop music videos on YouTube, then switching to financial headlines on Bloomberg, and later seeking discussions about your favorite soccer team's latest match on Reddit. It's a lot of clicks every day, even for subjects at the forefront of your mind, let alone those you want updates on but tend to forget.

(3) The reading list is extensive. Even if every text is relevant, it takes time to go through them page by page, line by line.

So, this app essentially addresses the three issues: It puts the sources and subjects under your control, consolidates them into one place, and provides concise summaries. Now, easy reading!
